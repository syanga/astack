# astack

Keep your coding agents' instructions, skills, and settings in one repository
and install them across macOS and Linux machines.

astack provides:

- Shared instructions with additions for each agent.
- Reusable skills, including their scripts and supporting files.
- Selected settings merged into agent configuration without replacing unrelated keys.
- Repeatable installation and removal, with conflict checks for local edits and
  restoration of managed settings to their original values.
- An optional [Gitleaks pre-push hook](skills/open-pr/scripts/git_hooks.py)
  to scan commits for secrets. Install and remove it separately from agent configuration.

## Install

You need Git, a POSIX shell, and Python 3.10 or newer. Install your coding agents
separately.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/syanga/astack.git
cd astack
./install.sh --help
./install.sh --dry-run
./install.sh
```

Use `--help` to see supported targets and defaults. To choose agents, pass
`--target <name>` for each one, or `--target all` for every supported agent.
Use the same targets for the preview and installation.

## Customize

Edit the source files, then rerun `./install.sh` with your chosen targets.
Installed instructions and skills are copies, so moving the checkout does not
break them. Restart your agent or reload its instructions and skills after installation.

The repository defines what gets installed:

| Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [instructions/](instructions/) | Shared preferences and additions for each agent |
| [skills/](skills/) | Available skills and their usage instructions |
| [settings/](settings/) | Settings to manage |
| [harnesses.json](harnesses.json) | Supported agents, destinations, and configuration sources |

In a JSON destination, a source value of `{"$entries": [...]}` adds its entries
to the list at that key and keeps the list's other entries. Uninstall removes
only the entries it added.

For contribution rules, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Find a skill

Ask [astack-help](skills/astack-help/SKILL.md) which skills fit your current task.
It reads the installed skills and recommends what to use next.

## Update or remove

After pulling source changes, rerun the installer with the same targets.
It updates managed files and removes skill files deleted from the source.
Conflicting local edits stop installation. To back up and replace conflicts,
preview with `--force --dry-run` before running with `--force`.

To remove an installation, use the same targets with `./uninstall.sh`.
Preview removal with `--dry-run`. Uninstall preserves unrelated files and
restores managed settings. It does not restore file backups automatically.

## Verify changes

Run the test suite, which uses temporary directories:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

To preview installation without using your agent configuration, run
`./install.sh --target all --home /tmp/astack-demo --dry-run`.
